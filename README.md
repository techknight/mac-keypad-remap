Remap your Mac-style numeric keypad to function as a PC-style layout

PC numeric keypads usually have a large plus key, followed by minus in the corner, then the asterisk and the slash.

Mac numeric keypads usually have a small plus key, followed by minus, and then the asterisk in the corner.

Out of all the keyboard changes that one has to adjust to when using both Windows and MacOS devices, this difference is the most uncomfortable for me.

Using the MacOS tool hidutil, keypad_remap.sh will remap a Mac numeric keypad to behave more like a PC one. Using keypad_unmap.sh will undo the change.

The information about hidutil that I referenced came from here:
